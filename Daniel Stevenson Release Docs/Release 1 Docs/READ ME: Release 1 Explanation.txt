The majority of my artefacts relate to the overall design and aesthetic of the website itself. For the first release this began with sketches of initial layout, which was transferred into a working powerpoint prototype. The images incorporated in that prototype and eventually the end product is attached in the images file. The sprint 1 review letter was also included, which I put together and contributed roughly one third of. A selection of the colours was required and carried on into the 2nd release. Also attached are the social media updates that laid out the plan for the team moving forward.
