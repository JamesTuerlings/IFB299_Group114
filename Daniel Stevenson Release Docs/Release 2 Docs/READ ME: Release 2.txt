The artefacts for the 2nd release included more updates for the team from social media. The majority of the changes were amalgamated into a final prototype which became the template for the final website. The colour changes continued and were finalised here. The 2nd peer review business letter also contained my contribution, this time to the expectations and preparation for the presentation.
