1. Burndown Charts and Burndown documentation:
Throughout the semester I kept track of our story points
as well as obtaining short diary-like entries from the team
I graphed our final progress and included the team's comments

2.Story Cards:
I was most responsible for creating and fleshing out the stories
that we chose to use in our final product. I created a large number,
fixed the other's cards, and wrote all of the priorities and acceptance criteria, as well
as assigning the number of story points.

3. Unit testing:
I created some unit tests for the Selenium Platform in order to properly 
test the websitesinitial functionality, I ran them and used them to fix some
bugs in the php once the website had been uploaded to the server

4.Server Setup:
I setup the Server that we used to host our website. The Full explanation
can be found in the document. (52.64.22.175 is the address)

5. Release plan 1:
I wrote the initial release plan based on the story cards that I created,
the others finished the sprint plans and worked on the software.


I chose these artefacts because I believe they show that I took part in both
the documentation and Agile concepts as well as working on the project itself.
