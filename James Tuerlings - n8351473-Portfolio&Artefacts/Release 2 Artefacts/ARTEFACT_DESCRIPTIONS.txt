Artefact Descriptions 2

1.Burndown and Commentary:
Similarly to the first release I tracked our progress, wrote diary entries
compiled the other entries and constructed various charts to show our progress

2.Database:
I created the MySQL database/tables that we used for the project
Including the ordering table, customer table, employee table, order table and
recipient table. I uploaded these to the server through putty and rebuilt the table
through the Ubuntu command line.

3.Employee Validation:
I added the PHP needed to validate employee details when they attempted
to log into the server

4. Logo PHP:
Using the images that the others made, I wrote some PHP to include
it into the website

5.Unit and Integration testing:
I expanded my Selenium test suite from part 1 to cover all the new functionality
that we had added to the website. Additionally I added some integration tests
to ensure that the seperate parts were working as a whole once we brought the
project together


I chose these artefacts because my part 1 contributions leaned towards the documentation side of things
and I wanted to show that I also took part in the implementation and testing of the project.
